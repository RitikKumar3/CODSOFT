<h2> CODSOFT INTERNSHIP</br>DATA SCIENCE-JAN24 </h2>

</br>

### ‚ìÇÔ∏è REQUIREMENTS :

- Jupyter Notebook

### PLATFORM USED :

- Windows Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

</br>

### üìù TASK 1 :

- Credit Card Fraud detection

Tasks Performed:

-  Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.

- Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- Trained some classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or under sampling for improving results.

### üìù TASK 2 :

- Iris Flower Classification
 
Tasks Performed:

- The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that we have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.

- Our objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.

- We use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

### üìù TASK 3 :

- Titanic Survival Prediction
 
Tasks Performed:

Description:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build classification model to predict weather the passenger survives or not.
- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms

Stractegic Plan of Action:
- Data Exploration
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Pre-processing
- Data Manipulation
- Models
- Project Outcomes & Conclusion
